_This is a collection of posts and threads related to Chainlink, from a security-first development perspective._

_I have no affiliation with Chainlink. Only a genuine interest and a strong enthusiasm from a developer’s perspective, with a keen focus on security, robustness, and accessibility. Which I want to share, as I believe in products you can actually use and benefit from. I’m convinced that there is no stronger bet, as a developer, than getting involved in their ecosystem as early as possible._
